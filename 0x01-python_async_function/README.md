## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without the help of Google:
- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module


## Tasks

### 0. The basics of async
**Mandatory** | **Score:** 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
- Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (`max_delay`, with a default value of 10) named `wait_random` that waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.
- Use the `random` module.
